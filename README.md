# PixelKits v2

**A retro creature-collecting RPG that runs in your browser.**

> **v2 is a full rebuild in progress:** a brand-new roster with a unique design for every Kit, bigger hand-built towns and routes, gyms with their own challenges, and a reworked story. The original game stays at https://github.com/aryanyaksh-art/PixelKits. The feature list below describes v1 and will be rewritten as v2 takes shape.

Explore the land of **Lumora**, catch and raise **110 original Kits**, challenge **8 Gym Wardens**, stop the **Hollow Syndicate**, climb **Crown Summit** to face the **High Council** and the **Champion** — then sail to the secret **Moonlit Isles** and uncover the secrets of **Starfall**.

PixelKits is inspired by the classic handheld monster-collecting RPGs of the late '90s and early 2000s. Every creature, character, place, move, item, sprite, tile, sound and song in it was made from scratch for this project.

## Features

- **110 original Kits** across 16 types (Plain, Blaze, Tide, Leaf, Volt, Frost, Brawl, Venom, Terra, Gale, Mind, Swarm, Shade, Lumen, Metal, Wyrm), with 2- and 3-stage evolutions by level, by elemental shard, or by time of day. Rare **Prism** color variants (1 in 512).
- **Deep battle system**: single and **double battles** (2 vs 2, with targeting and moves that hit both foes), **32 abilities**, **25 temperaments** (+10% / -10% stat natures), hidden **genes** and **Training Points** earned from battles, type matchups, critical hits, status conditions, stat stages, priority, multi-hit, recoil, drain, switching, items and catching.
- **Three regions** — Verdant Vale, Sunscar Coast and Frostcrown Highlands — plus the Crown Summit League, 85 maps in all: towns, trails, forests, caves, a volcano, a desert, an ice cavern, a villain tower and ancient ruins.
- **Secret areas**: the Hidden Hollow and Glacier Grotto caves, and the post-game **Moonlit Isles** (ferry from Saltmarsh) with 10 island-only Kits, a new Syndicate story and a Moon Guardian.
- **Wildwood Reserve** safari park: 30 Safari Capsules, 500 steps, Snacks and Claps instead of battling.
- **8 Gyms** with themed puzzles, **93 Keepers** who spot you from a distance (some in pairs for double battles), a rival who grows with you, the **Hollow Syndicate**, the **High Council** of four and the **Champion**.
- **Rally Bell** rematches (keepers come back stronger), a **Recall Master** who re-teaches forgotten moves, stat **Roots** and **Boost Candy**.
- **Lumora Map** that shows where you are; the **Wayfinder** flies you to any town you've visited.
- **Trail Bike**, running (hold B), Machete / Pickaxe / Raft field tools, a Seeker Lens for hidden items, Exit Cords for caves. Cleared bushes and rocks stay cleared.
- **Day/night cycle** from your real clock — some Kits only appear at night or in the morning.
- **Move details everywhere**: a move card when learning, a full move screen (type, power, accuracy, charges, description) when choosing what to forget, descriptions in the battle move menu, shops, Skill Discs and the Recall Master.
- **Edit your Kits** (party menu → EDIT, or the Name Sage in Pinecrest): rename, reorder or forget moves, and pick one of 9 color tints.
- **Menus**: party, 4-page summary, bag with pockets, KitLog, shops, clinics, storage terminal, keeper card, options.
- **3 save files**, plus **export/import save codes** to move a save between devices.
- **Original chiptune soundtrack** (30 tracks) and sound effects synthesized live with WebAudio, and a unique procedural cry for every Kit.
- **Touch controls** on phones and tablets.
